I am currently working in Translational Neuroengineering Lab(TNEL) at UCSD, supervised by Prof. Vikash Gilja. I received my BEng in Control Science and Engineering from Zhejiang University in 2015.\nMy research interests focus on brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) and machine learning. By using signal processing and machine learning techniques, I develop tools to analyze brain neural signals e.g., neural spike trains, Electrocorticography (ECoG) and Electroencephalography (EEG). My goal is to develop neural prosthesis to resort the lost mobility in individuals paralyzed.\nDownload my CV --","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://sniper-lai.github.io/author/jiaming-lai/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/jiaming-lai/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a master student in Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of California, San Diego.
